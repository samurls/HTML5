			There are lots of different kinds of fruit - 
			there are over 500 varieties of banana alone. 
			By the time we add the countless types of apples, 
			oranges, and other well-known fruit, we are faced 
			with thousands of choices.

			One of the most interesting aspects of fruit is the 
			variety available in each country. I live near London, 
			in an area which is known for its apples.

			When travelling in Asia, I was struck by how many 
			different kinds of banana were available - many of which 
			had unique flavours and which were only avaiable within a 
			small region.
