        True cherry fruits are borne by members of the subgenus Cerasus, which is 
        distinguished by having the flowers in small corymbs of several together 
        (not singly, nor in racemes), and by having a smooth fruit with only a weak 
        groove or none along one side. The subgenus is native to the temperate 
        regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with two species in America,
        three in Europe, and the remainder in Asia. The majority of eating cherries 
        are derived from either Prunus avium, the wild cherry (sometimes called the 
        sweet cherry), or from Prunus cerasus, the sour cherry.
